## Notes

* **Note**: The server side is a fork from the original repo which you can find at: [osartun/scoober-fe-challenge-starter](https://github.com/osartun/scoober-fe-challenge-starter). It contains [some bug fixes and an upgrade of `socket.io`](https://github.com/takeaway/scoober-fe-challenge-starter/compare/master...osartun:scoober-fe-challenge-starter:master).
* Although I did make changes to the server side I focused on the client side / front end. For a production-ready app more time should be invested on the server side. For exampleâ€¦
  * To validate the inputs coming from the client
  * To test the game's logic
  * To do proper QA and fix the remaining bugs which I didn't invest time in fixing
* Tech decisions
  * I used Gatsby for this application as I have lots of experience with it and therefore it was the fastest way for me to bootstrap a project like this. It included most of the required technologies out of the box.
  * I didn't spend time setting up a CSS pre / post processor (like Sass or something similar). So, I'm using native CSS but modularized through CSS modules.
  * In the interview it was said that using Redux as the state management tool was not mandatory. However, I considered it appropriate and used it nonetheless.
